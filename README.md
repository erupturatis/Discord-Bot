# Discord Bot

A discord bot I made while learning javascript.
 If you write in a discord chat  wiki + a keyword of choice
it will try to find a wikipedia page for that keyword and return the first 20 links
from the page found. For example writing:


```http
  wiki germany
```
### Will output the following

### While on the other hand will output

```http
  wiki randomWordThatDoesntHaveAWikiPage
```

# You can host the bot from here
```
docker pull erupturatis/node-bot:1.0.0
```
